<!-- 
The Create list element in the SellerDashboard in the navbar should be a sublist item of the Campaigns.

Since there was little support in Bootstrap 3.7 for submenus, I had to research to find a workaround for creating a submenu.  Once the submenu was created,
both submenu items were highlighting on hover.  However, I was able to pinpoint each particular item using more precise CSS element targeting, thus resolving this issue.
